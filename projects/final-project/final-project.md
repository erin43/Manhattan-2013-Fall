# Final Project Topic Requirements

4. You should pick a topic that you feel passionate about.

# Final Project Parameters (not in order)

1. All pages must be valid.
1. All pages must be meaningful. Each page says something or provides a cohesive idea about your overall project.
1. All pages must be unique. Each page must provide a different piece of content than other pages. A site where 5 pages contain information about 5 different albums from the same band are not considered unique. Each page must bring a unique idea or piece of content.

# Video Notes
I have recorded a handful of short videos to help you along the way, Young Jedi. I have linked to the HD wide screen version of the videos and have added visual highlights to clicks and right clicks so that you can identify what I clicked on, when and why. I have not recorded a video for every single item, but the ones that I deemed to be the most difficult.

# Question and Answers

**What is the difference between a top level page and a second level page?**

> A top level page is usually linked from the main navigation. Secondary pages are not.

> For example, if you go to the [Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/) home page, you'll see a section called "Politics"; that's a top level page. If you go to the "Politics" page, you'll see a section called "Election Results" that you can go to. That is a secondary level page that can only be reached via the "Politics' section.

**Is it required to use a Dreamweaver template?**

> Well. I guess, not technically, but why wouldn't you use a template. A template reduces the amount of work you have to do dramatically and eliminates reduces the possibility of replicating mistakes.

**Are tables a requirement?**

> No.

**When I update my template and click on "Update", some of the updates do not appear on my pages.**

> To resync your template to all attached pages go to **Modify > Templates > Update Pages...**

**When I open up my project in Chrome, some pages won't open when I click on them. I linked them correctly in Dreamweaver.**

> If you moved or renamed any files, this may happen. Otherwise, you have not linked correctly. Relink the pages again.

**For the second level pages, should I create a new template?**

> No. Your template can be used for all pages. In my Doctor Who class example, I used one template for the entire site including first level and second level pages.

**How did you create the navigation table in class where the cells get colored depending on what page you are on?**

> This question is too complicated to answer in text form. So... [YouTube Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7TkLVOICA4&hd=1&wide)

**I can’t find the CSS panel and I selected the designer workspace.**

> With the designer workspace selected. Click the reset link in the workspace options. If that doesn’t work, go to the Window menu and select CSS Styles.

**I can’t see any of my styles.**

> Do you have a document open? No styles will display if you don’t have any documents open. Does your document have a style sheet attached? If it doesn’t, you won’t see any styles. Check that if you are on a page that you have first attached your template.

**I just downloaded and installed Dreamweaver on my Mac. Up until now I have been working on the Windows based PCs In the lab. Is this a problem and can I work interchangeably?**

> No, it's not a problem and yes you can work interchangeably. The software is identical aside from very few and minor cosmetic differences due to the OS. The files created by Dreamweaver are viewable on both platforms and therefore portable between the two. If you are bouncing back and forth between the lab and your PC, you can use GitHub to move things around. When you are working on your files and are going to wrap up, commit and sync to GitHub. When you go to the other computer, sync your repo down to your local computer; work on it and at the end commit and sync again. Then repeat the process each time you move from computer to computer. You don’t even need the USB drive to move files around in that scenario.
