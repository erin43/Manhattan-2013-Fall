#Mid Term Notes#

I've reviewed all of the submitted Doctor Who assignments and I have a few general notes.

1. Many of you are either adding or not removing additional spaces or hard returns that are causing pages to "jump" when linking from page to page. Be mindful of that.

2. Some of you almost got a perfect score except for the fact that you did not test your pages in a browser. Some sites had enough broken links that the site was unusable.

3. I notice that there are a lot of broken links that look like they are a result of either performing file management while one or more files are open/unsaved or not updating when Dreamweaver requests to update content.

These mistakes are easily correctible with rudimentary testing.

On the brighter side, a record smashing 7 of you got a perfect (or better due to curving) score on the Doctor Who version 1 site. That's indescribably awesome.

For those of you with grades that are not passing, time is still on your side.

At the end of the day mathematics will either work for you or against you based on your performance.
