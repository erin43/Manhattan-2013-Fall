        Opening the door to the classroom.
          I should never see students huddled in the hallway
        No food or beverages in the lab
        Temperature control
          Bring a sweater
    Themes
      Efficiency
        Your first page will take a long time to create.
        Each subsequent page will take less time.
        You should be striving to spend less time in production
      Planning
        Good planning decreases production time.
        Say what you want to accomplish out loud.
      Technology sucks.
        Technology will be an ongoing challenge.
        Your computer will crash.
      Problem solving
  Hour 2
    Grading Paradigm
      Everything is graded.
        My grades are not fair
        My grades are not unfair
        They are a measure of your work
        Sometimes they are subjective
      This is a production class.
        There is no grade for trying.
      Project submission will always be electronic.
        The parameters for submission will be provided. If you do not know the submission requirements. Ask.
        Never by email.
      Assignments are due before class.
        I will take measures to preempt you from submitting your assignments during class.
      Assignments are small and build on top of preceding assignments
        Some assignments can not be completed without the prior assignment being completed.
      If you need help from me, you must be judicious with what you ask me and when
        If you email me at 1am the night before an assignment is due, I may not even see your email
      I grade you for your work, not mine.
      This class is challenging, but not hard.
        ...unless you do not complete your assignments.
      The Holy Crap Half Grade Rule
        Late assignment = half grade deduction for the assignment per day
        Assignments that are late by the next session will receive a zero.
      The Pet Peeves Half Grade Rule
        Mobile device = half grade penalty for final grade.
        Absence = half grade penalty for final grade.
        Communication Department: 4 hours is grounds for an F
        What if I you are late to class?
          Don't be late.
      Access to the lab outside of class time.
      Assume there is a test every week
        Is there a test next week?
          Assume "yes"
        What is on the test?
          Everything we discuss is fair game
      Look up all concepts in Wikipedia and read their relevant entry
        You only need to read the brief at the top.
      Review your grades frequently.
        I will grade assignments within one week
        You have one week to dispute it.
        After that, it's etched in stone.
        I'm not debating grades at the end of the semester.
      If you have questions or concerns
        Do not approach me before class
          Not because I don't want to talk
          Because I'm distracted
        Email me
          Give me time to consider your question
          I'll always respond

    Calendar Overview
  Hour 3
    Final Project
      You pick the topic, but I must approve it.
        The topic must not be broad
          "Sports" is not a good topic.
          The topic should be "niche". In other words cover a specific topic.
        The topic must allow for a diversity of content
          A site where you have a bunch of pages of albums you like is not very interesting.
          If you are going to have a similar pages (e.g. recipes), find something to make the pages interesting.
        The idea is to create an interesting site.
      Requirements
        Content Research
        Image Research
        Planning
        Construction
      In class projects & assignments will parallel the final project
    Going off the reservation.
      Mac vs. PC
      Using computers outside of the lab.
      Buying Adobe Dreamweaver
      Creative Cloud
      Bring your own computer
    Getting Help
      YouTube
      Google
      Stack Overflow
      Adobe Web Site
      There is no lack of information on the Internet about the topics being covered in class.
    Validation and Specifications
      What is validation and why does it matter?
      Why XHTML 1.1. and not HTML 5?
    How to communicate with me via email.
      Be succinct.
      Write your email, proofread it.
      Then write it again at half the length.
      Be specific about what you want.
      Be specific about the issue that you are having.
      Scheduling time is important.
      I have a fundamentally different schedule than you.
      Your emails do not make more sense with more words.
    Email Dos and Don'ts

          Hello Ralph,
          I was just looking at my Blackboard grade and I noticed that I received a B in the class according to Blackboard, but a B- in the class on Self Service.
          Thank you
        Don't Follow Up
          Hello Ralph,
          I sent you an email last week about my grade. I was confused as to why I had a B on Blackboard but a B- in the class. I wanted to know some of the details of my grade. I want to know what brought me down a whole grade level. I would also like to know the grade breakdown for Final Project Preview which I got a 79 on even though it was identical to yours and validated perfectly. I haven't heard back from you so I just wanted to check in because it has been a week. Thank you,
        Do
          Hello Ralph,
          I just compared my grade on Blackboard and Self Service. The former shows a B and the latter shows a B-. Can you explain the difference between the grades and how you came to my final project grade so that I understand it?
          Thanks
      Example #2
        Don't
          Dear Ralph,
          I know I didn't submit the gallery project on time. I was having trouble and because the computer I was using was messing up and I get a 0?
          That is not acceptable.
        Do
          Dear Ralph
          I had technical challenges getting my project completed on time. I have not yet submitted it. I would like to, but I need help.
          Can we set up time to talk?
