  Part 3
    Site Definition Basics
      What is a Site Definition?
        It tells Dreamweaver where your files are.
        It creates context.
        Dreamweaver doesn't know anything about your site until you tell it when it is.
        A properly configured site definition allows Dreamweaver to help you with your site.
